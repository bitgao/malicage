Packed malware poses a great threat to the security of computer networks. The features of malware are greatly changed by the packer, which affects the detection effect of machine learning models for malware classification. However, the lack of packed malware samples also causes the training of malware machine learning models to be prone to underfitting. Motivated by the above challenges, a novel packed malware family classification framework called MaliCage is proposed, based on deep learning. The goal of the framework is to classify unpacked and packed malware simultaneously.
